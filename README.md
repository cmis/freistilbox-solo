# Introduction

**freistilbox Solo is a virtual development environment, optimized for users of our [freistilbox hosting platform](http://www.freistilbox.com).**

It is our answer to many requests by customers that want to develop and test their web applicaton in an environment that is highly similar to our production platform.

freistilbox Solo uses [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) to launch a virtual machine based on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). The setup of the virtual Linux server is completely automated with [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/).


# Installation

Clone the freistilbox Solo repository to your workstation:

    $ git clone https://github.com/freistil/freistilbox-solo.git


# Requirements

## Ruby

Install a current Ruby interpreter if it is not already provided by your operating system.

All necessary Ruby gems are installed via `bundler`:

    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle


## Virtualbox

Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).


## Vagrant

Download and install [Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html), version 1.2.x and up.

To make the initial VM setup and the software provisioning runs faster, install a Vagrant plugin that caches downloaded software packages locally:

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier


# Getting started

## Start the VM

Execute `rake up` to start the VM and the application provisioning process.

freistilbox Solo will automatically set up a development website for the application you configured in the `Vagrantfile`; the default app is "example" which contains a vanilla Drupal site.


## Choose the active application

You can use freistilbox Solo with as many applications as you like, just put each one into a separate folder below the `apps` directory. The active application is defined with the keyword `:active_app` in the `Vagrantfile`:

    chef.json = {
      :freistilbox => {
        :active_app => 'example',
        :app_config => 'drupal'
      }
    }

(So far, "drupal" is the only `app_config` value supported.)

After changing the `active_app` value, you need to update the dev environment by issuing the `rake prov` command.

Delow the application directory in `apps`, you need to create a `docroot` directory containing your web application and a file named `Boxfile` that defines certain properties of your application that freistilbox needs to know. The Boxfile format is explained in the [freistilbox documentation](http://docs.freistilbox.com/basics/boxfile/).


## Provision and access your app

After each update to your application code, run `rake prov` to have them reflected in the development environment.

You should now be able to access your development website in your browser at "http://localhost:3080".


## Shell login

To get direct shell access to the development environment, execute `rake login`.


## Shutting down the VM

Run `rake down` to shut down the virtual server. You can resurrect it at any time with `rake up`.


## Destroying the VM

To completely remove the virtual server and all its contents, use the `rake destroy` command.

CAUTION: The database is only stored within the VM and will be lost during `destroy`. (See "File storage" below.) If you need to preserve the database, be sure to make a backup and put that into one directory you defined in `shared_folders` in the Boxfile.


# File storage

While Vagrant allows the virtual server access to certain direcotories on the host filesystem (aka your workstation), this shared filesystem is not fast enough to have a satisfying development experience. That's why the current state of your application is copied into the VM at each provisioning run (`rake prov`).

**When the VM is removed (aka "destroyed"), these files will be lost.**

The only exception are the directories declared as `shared_folders` in your application's `Boxfile`. These directories are connected to the shared filesystem stored on your workstation.

**You need to make sure that your workstation allows write access for these directories to the VM.**

Taking Drupal as an example:

    $ chmod a+w apps/example/docroot/sites/default/files
